    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>

    <p>
      By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it
      renders outside the element's box:
    </p>

    <div class="visible">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>

    <hr />
    <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>

    <p>
      With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the
      content is hidden:
    </p>
    <p>Try to remove the overflow property to understand how it works.</p>

    <div class="hidden">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>

    <p>
      Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a
      scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a
      scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):
    </p>

    <div class="scroll">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h2>Overflow: auto</h2>

    <p>
      The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when
      necessary:
    </p>

    <div class="auto">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h2>Overflow-x and overflow-y</h2>

    <p>
      You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
      overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.
    </p>

    <div class="box1">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>
